## Minutes for July 10th

### Working toward reproducibility over the long term

In addition to our primary goal of building basic R proficiency as a group, with special attention to data cleaning and wrangling, our secondary goal should be developing the skills to use R markdown to create "live" reports that allow for real-time updating of report charts and data contained in them.  

### Review of Tidyverse

1. Everyone should install the tidyverse package in their R Studio  
2. Pipes are great and will be a gamechanger for future learnings  
3. Tidyverse is made for 5 main packages  

    * dplyr - basic data manipulation toolkit, inspired by SQL commands  
    * tidyr - reshape data
    * purrr - do the same thing to collections of things 
    * ggplot - the grammar of graphics
    * stringr - vectorized string manipulation tools
    * forcats - factors are very weird, forcats makes them less so
    * readr - import tabular data

4. `Thomas's Tidyverse Mantras`  

    * Don't be afraid of short lines  
    * Don't be afraid of white space  
    * Make assignments meaningful (long and useful is always better than short and meaningless)  

5. Update R to at least version 3.6.1

### GitHub and working together

1. Create a Github account with a repository  
2. Copy and paste the url for your repository and past it as a comment week 2: get github up and running issue under the issues tab  

    * We will be using issues as a place to have discussion but be working seperately in our own reporsitories for the class  
    * Minutes and agendas will be posted under the code tab 
    * Will create command cheatsheets and other shared resources to build off of in this space

3. Connect your github account to your Rstudio - instructions in the 3rd week's lesson in Class one data scientist tool box   

### Next week's meeting

* Finish Week 1 material and record any questions
* We will review the quiz together, record your answers to bring to next class
* Do the swirl practice if you wish
* Look at the Additional Resources and Exercises folder (coming soon)
    

## Relevant resources

### Getting set up 

Install R and RStudio using [this guide](https://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) from Jenny Bryan's Stat545 class. 

### The life changing magic of hadley wickham: why the tidyverse sparks joy 

The packages in the tidyverse contain functions designed to make it easier to break down complex operations into meaningful, composable, literate chunks. They incentivize thoughtful variable assignment, efficient table construction, and a functional programming style that are all critical components of effective data analysis code. 

- See Jenny Bryan's [introduction to dplyr](http://stat545.com/block009_dplyr-intro.html) to start getting a feel for dplyr, the workhorse of the tidyverse, or 
- Or the [transform](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter of Wickham's *R for Data Science* for a bit more in-depth explanation

### Git over here: why we're also learning git

As the group of people doing data analysis at Blueprint expands, so will opportunities for collaboration. We're learning git so that collaborating ends up being helpful and exciting, rather than onerous, miserable, and tiresome. 
Git and github add some overhead to the learning process, but incorporating them into our class workflow will give us a chance to try things out and resolve technical difficulties before the rubber meets the road. 

- See Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html) for a detailed and generalizable version of the above. 

### How to get help

If you have any questions about anything listed above, get in touch with Thomas or Alberta. If you're trouble shooting some code, open an issue in this repository.
