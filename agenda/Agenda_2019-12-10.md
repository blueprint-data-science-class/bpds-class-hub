### Agenda

- New faces, what's with that? (10 minutes)
- Key concepts! (10 minutes) 
- Activity (30 minutes) 
- High-five and be awesome (5 minutes)

### dplyr 

The `dplyr` package forms the backbone of the tidyverse. It offers a powerful, robust, domain-specific language for working with rectangular and relational data that is generally preferred over a base R approach because of its consistent syntax, readable style, and alignment with SQL terminology.

#### The Five VIPs

- `select()` the right columns
- `mutate()` to add or change columns
- `filter()` for the rows you want
- `arrange()` them in the right order
- `summarize()` to calculate aggregate statistics

#### The Party Planner

- `group_by()` tells R to apply any subsequent VIP functions **by the groups specified**

### RStudio projects

#### What is a project? 

- A project is where your analysis lives. 
- It should contain all of the data, scripts, and outputs associated with the analysis. 
- When you open a project in RStudio, it uses the location of the project to determine your working directory. 

#### Why is it good? 

- Relative paths are portable. Wherever the project goes, Rstudio will understand how to find the files it needs. 
- Self-contained analyses are reproducible.
- Building projects will give you a blueprint for building packages

#### How do they get used at Blueprint? 

- I have an RStudio project for every one of my Analysis projects
- I use them so that I can flip between projects without worrying where R thinks it is, so that I can remember where I left off, and so that other people leave my shit alone
- For analysis projects using R, initializing an RStudio project will become the first step for everyone

### Activity 

- Make a project
- Get the data
- Make a script that: 
  + reads the data, 
  + explores the five key dplyr verbs
  + generates a bar chart that represents the annual volume of oil spills between 1968 and 1991
