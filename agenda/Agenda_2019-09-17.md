## Better Together Edition

### Agenda: 

- Concept: TWO BECOME ONE (joins, binds, etc) 
- Activity: __not sure__ (depends on the data set) 
- Assignment review / work period: you can leave when it's done
- High-five and be awesome

### Group Activity: 

We're going back to `dplyr` for this one to get acquainted with the functions that put different tables together: 

- same information about more things? `bind_rows()`
- new information about same things? `left_join()`
- thinking it would be better to `bind_cols()`? THINK AGAIN
- let's make a ggplot
- possible bonus: yo dawg, I heard you liked tables in your tables so I used `group_nest()` to put tables in your tables...

### Assignment review / "free" time

- progress and challenges
- free work period
