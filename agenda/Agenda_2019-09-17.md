### Resources

For a refresher on how joins work, check out [Chapter 14](https://stat545.com/multiple-tibbles.html#joins-in-dplyr) of Jenny Bryan's [Stat 545](https://stat545.com) course material. 
Stat 545 is an excellent overall resource, so you'll notice me referring to it often.

If you want to know more about how ggplot2 works, look to [Chapter 4](https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/visualizing/) of [R-Journalism](https://learn.r-journalism.com/).
