### Agenda

- Concept: Reading and processing multisheet excel workbooks
- Activity: Bringing .xlsxy back
- Any data-related questions / comments?  
- High-five and be awesome!

### Group activity

This activity will involve more work outside the console than in, so you shouldn't need to download it. 
Click [this link](../activities/xlsxy_2019-10-16.md) to check out the instructions. 

### About projects, again

Today, we're going to explore RStudio Projects as a way to organize data, script, and output files. 

#### What is a project? 

- A project is where your analysis lives. 
- It should contain all of the data, scripts, and outputs associated with the analysis. 
- When you open a project in RStudio, it uses the location of the project to determine your working directory. 

#### Why is it good? 

- Relative paths are portable. Wherever the project goes, Rstudio will understand how to find the files it needs. 
- Self-contained analyses are reproducible.
- Building projects will give you a blueprint for building packages

#### How do they get used at Blueprint? 

- I have an RStudio project for every one of my Analysis projects
- I use them so that I can flip between projects without worrying where R thinks it is, so that I can remember where I left off, and so that other people leave my shit alone
- For analysis projects using R, initializing an RStudio project will become the first step for everyone
