#### Objectives

- make some shot charts that look vaguely like the ones above
- get familiar with the nuts and bolts of the sf package: 
  + simple features data frames
  + tesselation / aggregation
  + spatial joins

#### Instructions

- make a project (like we always do)
- this time, also create an "output" folder
- download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1suvL4LvWyk-eCzbFwzJ25Y0tE9MAGM9I)
- make a script that does the following: 
  + read and rename the raw data
  + filter for shots from the 2001, 2010, and 2018 seasons
  + convert the data to a simple features data frame
  + aggregate and summarize shot frequency and expected value by a regular hexagonal grid
  + plot relative shot frequency by season 
  + identify valuable learnings / complain about the modern NBA
- save the chart to your output folder
