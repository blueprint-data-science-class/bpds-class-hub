### Agenda

- Concept: tidying, munging, modelling a bit
- Activity: The first one's always free, or is it?
- Any data-related questions / comments?  
- High-five and be awesome!

### Group activity

#### Objectives

- mass mutate with mutate_at
- master your factors
- figure out which drugs are the worst (or the best?) for employment and income

#### Instructions

- make a project (like we always do)
- this time, also create an "output" folder
- download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kvIzLvya7WLwN8-su0oUps-99V9cD2PF/view?usp=sharing)
- make a script that does the following: 
  + collapse booleans into categoricals 
  + visualize observed differences
  + regress employment and income against drug use
  + summarize results in charts
- save the charts in your output folder
