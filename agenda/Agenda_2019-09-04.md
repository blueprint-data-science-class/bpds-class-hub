### Group activity: dplyr verbs and split-apply-combine

The `dplyr` package forms the backbone of the tidyverse. It offers a powerful, robust, domain-specific language for working with rectangular and relational data that is generally preferred over a base R approach because of its consistent syntax, readable style, and alignment with SQL terminology.
In this first activity, we're going to use the gapminder dataset to illustrate the package's 6 core functions. 

Either copy the code as we go, or download the [activity worksheet](../activities/dplyr-code-along_2019-09-04.R)

#### Get the data

Run the following chunk of code in your console to load the gapminder dataset. 

```
install.packages("gapminder")

library(gapminder)
```

#### The Five VIPs

- `filter()` for the rows you want
- `select()` the right columns
- `arrange()` them in the right order
- `mutate()` to add or change columns
- `summarize()` to calculate aggregates

#### The Party Planner

- `group_by()` tells R to apply any subsequent VIP functions **by the groups specified**
