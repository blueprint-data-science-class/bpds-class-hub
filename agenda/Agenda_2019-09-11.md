### Group activity: Tidy Data

The concept of tidy data was first articulated in [this](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) paper. 

> Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure:
each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit
is a table. 

The definition is simple: in a tidy data set...

1. each column is a variable
2. each row is an observation
3. each type of observational unit is a table


In the wild, data is rarely tidy. Keeping these principles in mind offers a clear direction for virtually all data cleaning endeavours. 


Today's activity will only cover rules 1 and 2. Look forward to exploring rule 3 when we inevitably tackle joins. 
Download the [worksheet](../activities/tidy-data-code-along_2019-09-11.R) this week. 

We'll be working with the `tidyr` package, which should be installed already if you installed `tidyverse` last week. 
Please also install the `janitor` package.
