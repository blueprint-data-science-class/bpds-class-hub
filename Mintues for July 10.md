##Minutes for July 10th

1. In addition to our primary goal of building basic R proficiency as a group, with special attention to data cleaning and wrangling, our secondary goal should be developing the skills to use R markdown to create "live" reports that allow for real-time updating of report charts and data contained in them.  

2. Review of Tidyverse  
     1. Everyone should install the tidyverse package in their R Studio  
     2.  Pipes are great and will be a gamechanger for future learnings  
     3.  Tidyverse is made for 5 main packages  
        * dbplyer - load data?  
        * tidyr - reshape data  
        * purrr - functional iteration  
        * ggplot - build graphics  
        * stringr - string data together?  
    4. `Thomas's Tidyverse Mantras`  
        * Don't be afraid of short lines  
        * Don't be afraid of white space  
        * Make assignments meaningful (long and useful is always better than short and meaningless)  
    
    5. Update your RStudio to at least version 3.6.1  
        * Link to resources: https://bootstrappers.umassmed.edu/bootstrappers-courses/courses/rCourse/Additional_Resources/Updating_R.html  
    
3. GitHub and working together  
    1. Create a Github account with a repository  
    2. Copy and paste the url for your repository and past it as a comment week 2: get github up and running issue under the issues tab  
        * We will be using issues as a place to have discussion but be working seperately in our own reporsitories for the class  
        * Minutes and agendas will be posted under the code tab 
        * Will create command cheatsheets and other shared resources to build off of in this space
    3. Connect your github account to your Rstudio - instructions in the 3rd week's lesson in Class one data scientist tool box  
    
4. Next week's meeting 
    1. Finish Week 1 material and record any questions
    2. We will review the quiz together, record your answers to bring to next class
    3. Do the swirl practice if you wish
